# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
Hi! My name is Manal Ahmed. I studied Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology during undergrad. I am stoked to be a part of this Master's program, as I believe Bioinformatics is a very lucrative and robust field, especially considering the era we are in. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I want to learn the fundamentals of Python so that I can apply them to real-world research.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I’m really excited about the abundance of opportunities to learn. At times, I worry that I’m not absorbing or retaining everything as fully as I’d like. My hope is that when the moment comes, I’ll be able to apply the knowledge and skills I’ve gained in a meaningful way.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
I love snowboarding. I am excited to go as the winter season approaches.
